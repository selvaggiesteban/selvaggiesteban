*   Hosting on Cloudflare Pages allows you to host projects built with Astro with unmatched response speed thanks to its global edge network.
*   Integrating Resend and Cloudflare Turnstile ensures you have professional contact forms, spam-free and without the need to pay for traditional backend servers.
*   To avoid deployment errors like code 10014, it's mandatory to correctly configure the wrangler.jsonc file and declare the ID of the existing KV database.

## Why choose to host a website on Cloudflare Pages with Astro

When I decided to optimize the architecture of my projects, I realized that paying for dedicated servers for corporate websites was an unnecessary expense. By <strong>hosting a website on Cloudflare Pages with Astro</strong>, I not only reduce my infrastructure costs to zero, but I also offer my clients load times that break all Core Web Vitals records. Astro generates hyper-lightweight static HTML, and Cloudflare distributes it instantly worldwide.

However, the challenge was always: how do we make a contact form work if we don't have a traditional backend? That's where the magic of serverless functions and the Resend API comes in.

## Steps to host a website on Cloudflare Pages with Astro and Resend

The initial configuration defines the success of the project. For the ecosystem to work seamlessly, I've developed a strict technical playbook that I apply on every deployment. The first step is always to take ownership of the infrastructure by purchasing the domain on Cloudflare or, alternatively, delegating the DNS. Then, you create the account on Resend by verifying domain authority to avoid being flagged as spam.

### Framework configuration when hosting a website on Cloudflare Pages with Astro

Cloudflare requires the project to compile as a Worker if it detects API routes (like our form). Therefore, it's strictly necessary to configure Astro as a server in your `astro.config.mjs` file by installing the official Cloudflare adapter.

Furthermore, even if your project is database-agnostic, the adapter demands provisioning a session. To avoid the dreaded *Error 10014* deployment error, you must create a `wrangler.jsonc` file telling Wrangler the exact ID of an existing KV database in your panel. You can review the [official Cloudflare development documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-an-astro-site/) to fully understand the architecture of its Workers.

### Security and secret variables when hosting a website on Cloudflare Pages with Astro and Resend

Having the website online is useless if our contact form is broken or bombarded by bots. To fix this, you must implement Cloudflare Turnstile Captcha. Remember to always use the Public Key on the frontend and apply "Explicit Rendering" (a script that waits for the page to load 100% before drawing the widget) to prevent race conditions.

On the backend side, it's a non-negotiable requirement to configure the Resend and Turnstile secret variables directly in the Cloudflare Pages panel. In the Astro v6 code, you'll need to use the native import `import { env } from 'cloudflare:workers';` to correctly capture these keys.

Deploying modern technologies requires precision. If you need me to set up this maximum-speed architecture for your next business, I invite you to visit my [custom software development](/servicios/software-a-medida) section or send me a message today to start working together.
