## An emergency gave birth to an obsession

It all started with the infamous day-before-delivery panic. I had promised 200% quality in the quality control of a project — not just zero critical bugs, but a flawless experience — and I realized I had no objective way to measure whether I was actually achieving it.

Deadlines do get met, sure, but at what cost. Overtime, rushed decisions, features that get left behind. I needed a way to predict, before delivery, how many bugs I would find, how stable the system was, and whether the quality level truly reached that 200% I had promised.

That's how <strong><a href="https://github.com/selvaggiesteban/poisson_for_products" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Poisson Products</a></strong> was born.

## What is the Poisson distribution and what does it have to do with bugs?

The Poisson distribution models the probability of <strong>k events</strong> occurring in a fixed time interval, when events occur at a known average rate <strong>λ</strong>. It sounds mathematical, but it's simpler than it seems.

In the world of software development, bugs and tasks don't appear in purely random ways. They follow patterns. In small teams, bugs tend to follow a Poisson distribution: many days with no errors, and suddenly several on the same day. The Poisson distribution helps us anticipate those perfect storms.

*The chart shows three scenarios: λt = 1 (stable project), λt = 4 (moderate activity), and λt = 8 (high load). The higher the λt, the more the bell shifts to the right and the more events you can expect.*

## How Poisson Products works

Poisson Products is a CLI tool that analyzes your codebase, detects the technologies you use (supports over 45), and runs a configurable Poisson simulation to predict bugs, user behavior, and functional gaps over a period of up to 90 days.

### The 6-phase pipeline

<ol>
  <li><strong>Detect</strong> — Scans the project and automatically detects each technology present (Laravel, React, Astro, WooCommerce, etc.).</li>
  <li><strong>Scan</strong> — Extracts routes, controllers, models, views, components, middleware, and validations.</li>
  <li><strong>Index</strong> — Cross-references the code structure with best practices from the <code>30_days_coding</code> library.</li>
  <li><strong>Simulate</strong> — Runs the Poisson simulation: λ(t) = λ₀ · e^(αt) · (1 + β · sin(2πt/7)) · e^(-γt). This models daily growth, weekly cycles, and team fatigue.</li>
  <li><strong>Execute</strong> — Launches Playwright + Chrome DevTools, navigates critical routes, and captures real bugs.</li>
  <li><strong>Report</strong> — Generates a fix plan prioritized by severity and Poisson probability, plus UX, SEO, and functional gap analysis.</li>
</ol>

### Key parameters

The λ(t) formula incorporates real-world factors that any developer recognizes:

<ul>
  <li><strong>α (alpha)</strong> — Daily growth rate. A rapidly growing project has more bugs.</li>
  <li><strong>β (beta)</strong> — Weekly cycle amplitude. Mondays have more post-weekend bugs, Fridays fewer.</li>
  <li><strong>γ (gamma)</strong> — Fatigue factor. Over time, the team gets tired and bug density changes.</li>
  <li><strong>Seed</strong> — Seed for reproducibility. Same input = same results.</li>
</ul>

## Why did I build it?

Because <strong>I needed objective answers</strong>. When you promise 200% quality, you can't guess. You need data. You need to know:

- How many bugs remain to be discovered before launch?
- Does my codebase comply with industry best practices?
- Where are the functional gaps I'll have to explain?
- What should I prioritize to maximize impact on quality?

Poisson Products answers all of that with a simulation you can run locally, without depending on external services.

## The dream: a community around quality prediction

This project is open source (MIT license) and I uploaded it to GitHub with a clear dream: <strong>try it, break it, improve it</strong>.

Quality management in web projects is still very artisanal. We depend on individual experience, instinct, and "this smells off." Poisson Products proposes an approach based on data, statistics, and real automation.

If you work with tight deadlines, if you promise quality and want to back it up with numbers, or if you're simply curious about how the Poisson distribution can be applied to software development, I invite you to:

<ul>
  <li>Clone the repo: <code class="break-all">git clone https://github.com/selvaggiesteban/poisson_for_products.git</code></li>
  <li>Install: <code>pip install poisson-products</code></li>
  <li>Run: <code>poisson-products /path/to/your/project</code></li>
  <li>Open an issue, suggest a feature, submit a PR.</li>
</ul>

## What's next

Poisson Products is in its first weeks of life. I have plans to:

<ul>
  <li>Add more technology detectors</li>
  <li>Improve visual reports (HTML dashboard)</li>
  <li>Integrate Slack and email notifications</li>
  <li>Support for multi-team simulation</li>
</ul>

But the community builds the path. Every PR, every issue, every star on GitHub tells me that this isn't just another tool, but something we truly need in the industry.

So if you've made it this far, you already know. <strong>200% quality isn't promised — it's demonstrated</strong>. And Poisson Products is my way of proving it.
